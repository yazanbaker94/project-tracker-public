# Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented multi-tenant data isolation using organizations. Users belong to an organization and can only view/modify projects within their organization.

---

## üìã Implementation Summary

### Step 1: Database Schema ‚úÖ

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/config/migration_add_organizations.sql` (new)
- `backend/src/config/schema_with_organizations.sql` (new)
- `backend/src/utils/runMigration.ts` (new)
- `backend/package.json` (added `migrate:organizations` script)

**Changes:**
1. Created `organizations` table with:
   - `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
2. Added `organization_id` column to `users` table
3. Added `organization_id` column to `projects` table
4. Added foreign key constraints with proper cascading
5. Created indexes for performance
6. Created default organization and assigned existing data to it

**Migration Run:** ‚úÖ Successfully executed

---

### Step 2: TypeScript Types & Models ‚úÖ

**Backend Files Modified:**

1. **`backend/src/types/index.ts`**
   - Added `Organization` interface
   - Added `organization_id` to `User` interface
   - Added `organization_id` to `Project` interface
   - Updated `AuthRequest` to include `organization_id`

2. **`backend/src/models/Organization.ts`** (new)
   - `findById()` - Get organization by ID
   - `findAll()` - List all organizations
   - `create()` - Create new organization
   - `update()` - Update organization
   - `getUserCount()` - Count users in organization
   - `getProjectCount()` - Count projects in organization

3. **`backend/src/models/User.ts`**
   - Updated `create()` to require `organizationId` parameter
   - Updated `findByEmail()` to return `organization_id`
   - Updated `findById()` to return `organization_id`

4. **`backend/src/models/Project.ts`**
   - Updated `create()` to require `organizationId` parameter
   - Changed `findById()` to filter by `organization_id` (not `user_id`)
   - Renamed `findByUserId()` ‚Üí `findByOrganizationId()`
   - Updated `update()` to filter by `organization_id`
   - Updated `delete()` to filter by `organization_id`
   - Renamed `countByUserId()` ‚Üí `countByOrganizationId()`
   - Renamed `getStatsByUserId()` ‚Üí `getStatsByOrganizationId()`

---

### Step 3: Controllers & Middleware ‚úÖ

**Backend Files Modified:**

1. **`backend/src/controllers/authController.ts`**
   - **`register()`**: Assigns new users to default organization (ID: 1)
   - **`register()`**: JWT now includes `{ id, email, organization_id }`
   - **`login()`**: JWT now includes `organization_id`
   - Both return `organization_id` in response

2. **`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`**
   - **`authenticateToken()`**: Decodes `organization_id` from JWT
   - **`optionalAuth()`**: Also handles `organization_id`
   - `req.user` now includes `organization_id`

3. **`backend/src/controllers/projectController.ts`**
   - **`createProject()`**: Uses `organizationId` from JWT
   - **`getProjects()`**: Fetches all organization's projects
   - **`getProject()`**: Validates access by `organizationId`
   - **`updateProject()`**: Validates access by `organizationId`
   - **`deleteProject()`**: Validates access by `organizationId`
   - **`getProjectStats()`**: Returns organization-wide stats

---

### Step 4: Frontend Types & UI ‚úÖ

**Frontend Files Modified:**

1. **`frontend/src/types/index.ts`**
   - Added `Organization` interface
   - Added `organization_id` to `Project` interface

2. **`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`**
   - Updated `User` interface to include `organization_id`
   - Updated `AuthResponse` to include `organization_id`

3. **`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`**
   - Header now displays "Organization ID: X"
   - Stats section titled "Organization Overview"
   - Stats show "All team projects", "In progress", "Finished"
   - Clarifies that metrics are organization-wide

---

## üîí Security Features

### Data Isolation
- ‚úÖ Users can only see projects from their organization
- ‚úÖ All database queries filter by `organization_id`
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens contain `organization_id` for authorization
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ Create: Projects created with user's `organization_id`
- ‚úÖ Read: Only organization's projects returned
- ‚úÖ Update: Only organization's projects can be updated
- ‚úÖ Delete: Only organization's projects can be deleted

### Token Security
- ‚úÖ JWT includes `organization_id` (can't be tampered with)
- ‚úÖ Server validates organization context on every request
- ‚úÖ No client-side organization selection (prevent spoofing)

---

## üìä How It Works

### 1. User Registration
```
User registers ‚Üí Assigned to default organization (ID: 1)
                ‚Üí JWT created with organization_id
                ‚Üí User stored with organization_id
```

### 2. User Login
```
User logs in ‚Üí Server fetches user with organization_id
             ‚Üí JWT created with organization_id
             ‚Üí Frontend stores user data + token
```

### 3. Project Creation
```
User creates project ‚Üí JWT decoded (includes organization_id)
                     ‚Üí Project saved with user's organization_id
                     ‚Üí Only visible to users in same organization
```

### 4. Project Retrieval
```
User requests projects ‚Üí JWT decoded (includes organization_id)
                       ‚Üí Query filters: WHERE organization_id = ?
                       ‚Üí Returns only organization's projects
```

### 5. Statistics
```
User requests stats ‚Üí JWT decoded (includes organization_id)
                    ‚Üí Counts projects WHERE organization_id = ?
                    ‚Üí Returns organization-wide metrics
```

## üß™ Testing

See `backend/TESTING_MULTI_TENANT.md` for detailed testing instructions.

**Quick Test:**
1. Register two users (both in org 1)
2. User 1 creates a project
3. User 2 should see User 1's project
4. Manually move User 2 to org 2 in database
5. User 2 logs in again (new JWT)
6. User 2 should see NO projects

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Database Migration Required
Before deploying to production:
```bash
npm run migrate:organizations
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed.

### Backwards Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Existing users automatically assigned to default organization
- ‚úÖ Existing projects automatically assigned to default organization
- ‚úÖ Migration is non-destructive

   - Create/edit/delete organizations (admin only)
   - Organization settings page
   - Display organization name (not just ID)

2. **User Invitations:**

   - Accept/decline invitations
   - Organization selection during registration

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Admin, Manager, Member roles within organization
   - Permissions: create, read, update, delete
   - Project ownership tracking

### Phase 2 (Advanced Features):

   - Team member list
   - Activity feed
   - Analytics and reports

2. **Project Collaboration:**
   - Project assignments
   - Comments and notes
   - File attachments

3. **Billing & Limits:**
